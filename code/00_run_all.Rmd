## Summary 

This script runs all code to replicate figures and tables. 

The scripts are numbered in the order they should be run.

```{r}
## library packages 
library(here)
source(here("code", "helpers.R"))
## list of rmd files 
rmd_files <- list.files(path = file.path(here("code//")), pattern=".Rmd")   
rmd_files <- rmd_files[!rmd_files %in% "00_run_all.Rmd"]
## set seed for reproducibility 
set.seed(1)
for (cur_file in rmd_files[5:8]) {
	cat("================================\n")
  source(here("code", "helpers.R"))
	tictoc::tic(glue::glue("Finished with {cur_file}, time:"))
	cat("Running ", cur_file, "\n")
  	source_rmd(cur_file)
  	rm(list = ls())
  	tictoc::toc()
	cat("================================\n")
}
```
